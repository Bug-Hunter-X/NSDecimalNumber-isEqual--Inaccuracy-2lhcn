In Objective-C, a subtle bug can occur when dealing with `NSDecimalNumber` and comparing them for equality using the `isEqual:` method.  The issue arises from the internal representation of decimal numbers.  Even if two `NSDecimalNumber` objects represent the same numerical value, they might not be considered equal by `isEqual:` if their underlying structures differ slightly (e.g., different scaling factors). This can lead to unexpected behavior in comparisons and conditional logic.
